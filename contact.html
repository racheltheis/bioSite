                <h1>About Jeff</h1>
                <p>Meet Jeff Theis! Jeff is a 56-year-old retired father of two who has been married for 28 years to his wife, Marcey. He now lives in Aitkin, Minnesota, at what was once the family cabin. In 2021, Jeff and Marcey made the big decision to sell their home in the Minneapolis suburbs and move north to their favorite spot on the Mississippi River.</p>

                <p>Recently retired, Jeff spends his time on his many hobbies and enjoying the outdoors. In the winter, you’ll often find him ice fishing on Red Lake or participating in his bowling league. As spring arrives, he taps the maple trees around his house to make homemade syrup. Throughout the summer, Jeff tends to his garden, growing everything from zucchini and tomatoes to squash and watermelons.</p>

                <p>This year, Jeff is taking on a new challenge—beekeeping! He’s excited to build his own bee boxes and start harvesting local honey. With a newly built woodshop, Jeff also enjoys woodworking, creating everything from breadboxes to bunk beds.</p>

                <p>When he’s not busy with projects, Jeff enjoys traveling, with Alaska being one of his favorite destinations. He loves the quiet and space of living in nature, especially the beauty of having all four seasons.</p>

                <p>Jeff also recently discovered a passion for making ice cream, thanks to a birthday gift of an ice cream maker. He’s been experimenting with new flavors—check out his favorite ice cream recipes <a href="recipes.html">here</a>!</p>
